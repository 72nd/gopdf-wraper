# gopdf-wrapper

The [gopdf](https://github.com/signintech/gopdf) library is a great library for creating PDFs in golang. This wrapper provides some convince abstractions for recurring tasks. Like

- Maintain a default font size.
- Add formatted text.
- Add multiline text.
- gopdf-wrapper embeds the [Lato font](https://www.latofonts.com/) and [Liberation Sans](https://github.com/liberationfonts/liberation-fonts) which is probably enough for simple reports.

The code of this library is licensed under the [MIT License]() Lato as a font on the other hand under the [SIL Open Font License (OFL)](http://scripts.sil.org/cms/scripts/page.php?site_id=nrsi&id=OFL).
